Hello! I'm Tomáš, a graphic design student based in Votice, approximately 50 km from Prague. I graduated from Akademy Michael last year, earning the title DiS. Now, I aspire to attain a BcA. title, although its significance is comparable to the final exam we had in a subject akin to the bachelor's level.

Before enrolling at the Academy of Michael, I pursued studies at a secondary school to become a dental technician. It was a fascinating experience as we delved into subjects like somatology and stomatology.

Currently, I work as a graphic designer. I also dabble in photography, occasionally pose as a model for events, collaborate with my dad, and engage with a promoter group to organize events.

# My projects: 

## Fits (branding)
That was the school project. The assignment centered around creating our own brand, and my focus was on a non-existent brand called Fits. The emphasis was on sports clothing designed for exceptional comfort and a perfect fit. Additionally, it included a specialized YouTube channel demonstrating the correct techniques for various exercises and strength training, both in the gym and at home.

## Kutná hora

That was also a school project where the task involved creating a visual identity for a music festival in Kutná Hora. The venue chosen for the event was the St. Barbara's Cathedral.

## Améliora

This project is a tangible realization, crafted for my friend aspiring to establish her own salon. The visual identity centers around the term "améliora," inspired by her daughter Amélie's name, aiming to weave a personal touch. I coined the name "améliora" as it translates to beautiful in French. The entirety of the brand is meticulously constructed with vibrant and playful elements, reflecting a dynamic and colorful character.

## SmileFree

This campaign wasn't put into action, but it holds promise if I decide to execute it. This project was my graduation assignment at Michael Academy. It revolves around the International Day of Smiling, celebrated on the first Friday of October, with a core focus on sharing smiles wherever you go. Another pivotal aspect aims to enhance mental and psychological well-being through slogans like "I smile because I eat healthily" or "I smile because I exercise." The fundamental idea is that actively participating in activities that trigger hormones like serotonin and dopamine can aid in navigating post-COVID situations and other stressful scenarios, such as work or conflicts.

# Also taking a picture

## Fototshooting for Bohempia

As I mentioned, I'm also a bit of a photographer. Here, you can see a few of my latest photos that I took for the company BOHEMPIA.
