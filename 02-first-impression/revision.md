# FIRST IMPRESSION
# Hi! I am Tomáš Petera

## About me

**As a Creative Director with more than seven years of experience in visual arts,** my true passion lies in crafting visual identities. I hold a firm belief that the **visual identity forms the essence of a brand**. This belief drives my commitment to both the creation of branding and its marketing evolution.

My experience spans several years in **designing and optimizing websites for users**. My enthusiasm for learning isn't confined to just design and UI/UX; it also encompasses fields like marketing, psychology, and personal development.

I adhere to the Bauhaus principle that **form follows function**, upholding that my work should not only be aesthetically pleasing and timeless but also straightforward and practical for real-world application.

### What usually I get paid for:
- **Creativity** to outstand
- **Visual identity** that survives the test of time
- **Improvisation** or making miracles happen
- **Branding** that transcends the visual
- **Marketing** to capture the mind
- **Strategy** that makes sense for you
- **UI Design** and how we can interact with it
- **UX Optimization** not quite UX Research but almost there
- **UX Copywriting and funneling** how to make people think and do what we need them to do....
- **Business optimization** or how to get your money's worth

### What I enjoy to spend on: 
- Power building
- Fitness plans
- Diets and nutrition experimentation
- Supplementation
- Psychology
- Behavioral science
- Tech Enthusiast
- AI fanatic
- Fantasy and Sci-fi (DND and Star Wars to be exact!)
- Character writing and design
- Worldbuilding
- And of course, friends and family
