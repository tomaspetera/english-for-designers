**Creative**: I enjoy expressing myself in original and imaginative ways. I use a colorful and lively voice that captures the attention and imagination of the listeners. I like to play with words and use metaphors, similes and analogies to explain my point of view. I also use humor and irony to spice up my speech and make it more interesting.

## Tone
**Informal**: I prefer a relaxed and informal tone that suits most situations and contexts. I use a conversational and casual language that gives me naturalness and authenticity. I also use abbreviations, shortened words and slang words that give me friendliness and approachability. I do not care if I break some grammar rules, if it improves the fluency and expressiveness of my speech.

**Emotional**: I like to convey my feelings and emotions through my tone. I use different intonations, pitches and loudness to show my mood and attitude.

I also use facts, evidence and examples to support my claims and arguments. I do not hesitate or doubt myself, but rather speak with conviction and authority.

## Style
**I use emoticons**: I use emoticons to add more fun and personality to my text. I use them to express my emotions, reactions and opinions. I also use them to make my text more lively and attractive. I do not use them too often, but rather use them strategically and appropriately.

**I use CAPITAL LETTERS**: I use CAPITAL LETTERS to highlight certain words or phrases that I want to emphasize or draw attention to. I use them to show my enthusiasm, excitement or anger. I also use them to make my text more dramatic and powerful. I do not abuse them, but rather use them sparingly and moderately.

**Informal writing standards**: My texts are not very structured or formal. I write informally and spontaneously to reflect my personality and voice. I do not follow strict rules of text hierarchy or grammar, but rather use my own style and preferences. I also use abbreviations, acronyms and symbols to make my text shorter and more comfortable.
