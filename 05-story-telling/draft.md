# The Importance of Sleep

Hello, my name is Tomáš and today I want to talk about a frequently overlooked topic, which is sleep. 
Many people know that food, drink, and exercise are essential parts of our lives.

We can survive up to 21 days without food, only about 3 days without water, and even months without exercise. But has anyone ever really thought about sleep?

We all know that sleep is crucial for our health, yet many of us do not give it the attention it deserves. While humans can survive longer without sleep than without water, you surely know the feeling of waking up the morning after a party and having to do something. You can't even get out of bed, and many people attribute this to alcohol. But what if you didn't drink at that event? Why do you feel just as bad?

The reason is that the brain is a complex organ that goes through three processes during sleep: REM (rapid eye movement), nREM (non-rapid eye movement/deep sleep), and light sleep. As we fall asleep, we gradually move into light sleep, where our brain prepares for the deep sleep process. In this phase, neuronal connections are joined and strengthened, which helps to solidify what we learned during the day in our minds.

Then comes the REM phase, during which all neural connections between the brain and the body are disconnected. If this didn't happen, we would move in bed just as we do when awake. During this phase, we dream, and the brain goes through a pruning process, cutting off neural connections that haven't been used for a long time. Friedrich Nietzsche would say that in this phase, we come to terms with the real world.

These processes should ideally repeat five times during the night, which is why we need to sleep an average of eight to nine hours a day at our age. Caffeine and alcohol can disrupt the sleep cycle, so it's best to consume them in moderation or at least ten hours before bedtime.

I chose this topic because when I was younger, around 20 years old, going to clubs was a daily routine. I visited clubs about four times a week. I remember that time fondly, but it also showed me how important sleep is. During that period, I averaged about six hours of sleep a night and felt terrible every day. This also affected my eating habits – instead of cooking at home, I often opted for fast food. Fortunately, I discovered self-development books and became more interested in the importance of sleep. Books like 'The Circadian Code' by Satchin Panda and 'Why We Sleep' by Matthew Walker taught me all these essential facts.

Since then, I have been maintaining discipline: I go to bed regularly around 10 PM and wake up at 7 AM.
